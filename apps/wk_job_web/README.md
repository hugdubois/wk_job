To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `yarn install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## ADR

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is used rather than [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

If you don't have it you could install it via :

```shell
npm install -g yarn
```
